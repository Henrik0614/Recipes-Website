        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>200g Spaghetti</li>
            <li>100g Pancetta</li>
            <li>50g Pecorino</li>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by filling a large pot with water, don't skimp on the quantity, as they say in Italy "pasta needs space".</li>
            <li>Heat the water with a small handful of coarse salt.</li>
            <li>While waiting for the water to boil, cut the guanciale into small cubes (if you don't have any, substitute with pancetta) and fry them in a frying pan (not oiled!). Stop cooking when the guanciale is firm and golden.</li>
            <li>The water should now boil. While the pasta cooks, beat the eggs with a fork by adding the pepper, the salt (very little) and a handful of pecorino.</li>
            <li>When the pasta is cooked (between 10 and 12 minutes, try regularly) drain normally. Traditionally and ideally they should be "althed".</li>
            <li>Be careful, do not pass the saucepan under water and put it back on the stoves (off). She must stay warm.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pasta into the frying pan with the guancial and gently mix with a wooden spoon so that "pasca" is impregnated with the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Pour the whole thing into the saucepan (so still hot) and add the beaten eggs.</li>
            <li>Mix so that the eggs take lightly. Let us re-declare that the latter must not really cook and this operation therefore runs well off.</li>
            <li>Finally, second the taste, optionally add pepper and pecorino.</li>
            <li>Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
