            <li> In a frying pan, pour a little olive oil and fry the various vegetables one after the other for 5 minutes until they brown. Start with the peppers, then the eggplant, the zucchini, and finally the onions and tomatoes, which you will cook together.</li>
            <li> After cooking the vegetables, add them all to the tomatoes and onions, reduce the heat, and stir. Add a generous bouquet garni of thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves, season with salt and pepper, then cover and simmer for 40 minutes, stirring regularly.</li>
            <li> About 10 minutes before the end of cooking, add the two large crushed garlic cloves and re-cover. Feel free to taste and season again to your liking.</li>
